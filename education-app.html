                      <p><strong>Design Your App's UI/UX:</strong> Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to
                          visualize how your app will look and feel. This will help you to get feedback from users
                          and make necessary changes before the development phase.</p>

                  <li>
                      <p><strong> Develop and Test Your App:</strong> Start building your app using the selected
                          tools and technologies. Test the app thoroughly to ensure it is functioning as intended
                          and fix any bugs or issues that arise during the development phase.</p>

                  <li>
                      <p><strong> Publish and Promote Your App</strong> Once your app is complete, you can publish
                          it on the app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store) or host it on your website.
                          Promote your app through various marketing channels such as social media, email
                          marketing, and influencer partnerships.</p>
